        <h1>Cosmos University: Books Databank</h1>
        <p>This Databank contains entries on <%= "#{$db_books.count.humanize}" %> books that we have utilized to build the datasets which help to inform Cosmos University's Databanks and data models. As we complete the extraction, transmutation, and loading of this data into more usable pieces we update the records contained here.</p>
        <p><i>If you're interested in helping:</i> We're currently seeking more books that have deep amounts of data contained within them and individuals who would find joy in the process of modeling and extracting data from these books.</p>
