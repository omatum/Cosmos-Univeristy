        <h1>Plants Databank</h1>
        <p>This Databank contains entries on <%= $db_plants.count.humanize %> plants and lists their scientific, magical, ritualistic, and metaphysical propetries. This information is currently being gathered and updated as we accumulate it. This directory is scheduled to receive a major interface update shortly.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Look for any incorrect data</li>
          <li>Suggest data fields we could add</li>
          <li>Suggest plants we may have missed</li>
          <li>Folk names are hard to track down and map correctly, often we create duplicate entries because of an archaic folk name being replaced with a common folk name - be on the look out for records like this</li>
          <li>We're facing a large backlog of scientific data that must be processed into these records</li>
