        <h1>Cosmos University: Plants Databank</h1>
        <p>This Databank contains entries on <%= $db_plants.count.humanize %> plants and lists their scientific, magical, ritualistic, and metaphysical propetries. This information is currently being gathered and updated as we accumulate it. This directory is scheduled to receive a major interface update shortly.</p>
        <p><i>If you're interested in helping:</i> We are always on the lookout for incorrect information within this databank, often times plant names aren't correctly described in source materials and as a result we create duplicate entries on accident. Additionally we're facing a large backlog of scientific data that must be processed into these records.</p>
