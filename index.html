        <h2>Cosmos University: <i>A Practical Modern Mystery School</i></h2>
        <p>We are a group of researchers, engineers, artists, spiritualists, and dreamers determined to get to the bottom of what happens when we’re asleep. Our vision is to merge the spiritual nature and supernatural strangeness of dreams with open-minded science and engineered technology. We’re dedicated to developing the space of DreamTek: <i>Technology which is designed around exploring, exploiting, and engineering our dreams.</i></p>

        <p>What would it be like if you could engineer your own dreams? Imagine a future in which you could take full control of what your mind experiences as you rest – setting up a complex script of activities while awake that would activate and be fully envisioned inside of your dreamscapes. The possibilities of such control range from movie-like entertainment experiences to breakthrough mental health treatments to learning valuable new skills effortlessly. And maybe, <i>just maybe</i>, you could communicate with others in these dreams.</p>

        <p>Our initial research indicates that dreams may in-fact be a non-local shared experience. This means that multiple individuals share the same dream in a short period of time. Some of these experiences are tightly connected through near-network groups and some are total groups of strangers. We aim to emerge when these dream signals create a synchronization of shared experiences and to study this ancient phenomenon.</p>

        <p>We see a future in which individuals are more comfortable with interrogating their own dreams. For eons this type of interrogation has been left to soothsayers, psychologists, and dictionaries which aimed to rationalize the irrational experience of a dream. We must look at all of these rationalizations with new eyes, and apply technological scrutiny that wraps these symbolic definitions to the experiencer themselves. And, we must also keep in mind that there is a long history of prophetic dreams coming true.</p>

        <p>A brave new frontier awaits us within our own minds. <i>Are you ready?</i></p>
