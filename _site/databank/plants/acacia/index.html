It belongs to the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). There are approximately 1,000 species in this genus, which are found across tropical regions of the world.\n \nThe Acacia plant has been used for medicinal purposes throughout history. It has been used to treat various ailments, such as indigestion, diarrhea, and skin infections. However, its efficacy as a treatment for these conditions has not been clinically proven.\n———\nAcacia is a genus of shrubs and trees in the family Fabaceae (legumes). They are found throughout the tropics, with some species extending into temperate regions.\n———\nAcacia is a genus of shrubs or trees belonging to the family Mimosaceae. There are approximately 200 species of Acacia found throughout the subtropical regions of Africa, Asia and Australia. Some common names for acacias include: devilwood, prickly myrtle, sandpaper tree and black Wattle.\n \nThe leaves are usually bipinnate (with two sets of leaflets) and have a slender stem. The flowers are small and yellowish-white in color with five petals, and they grow in clusters at the ends of branches or along the trunk. The fruit is a pod containing several seeds that are oval in shape and approximately 2mm long. Acacias contain high levels of tannin which makes them useful as a leather substitute when processed correctly; this product was popular during WWII but fell out of favor after the war ended due to increased competition from other sources such as South America and China.\n \nThe wood from these trees is strong but lightweight making it an ideal construction material for things like ships, airplanes and automobiles; however this use has been largely replaced by more modern materials like plastics and aluminum which are cheaper to produce but offer similar strength properties. Today acacias are mainly used in herbal medicine as an anti-inflammatory agent or astringent due to their ability to reduce redness or swelling caused by injury or infection; however there has been some debate over whether or not these effects can be attributed solely to the tannins contained within the plant itself rather than other compounds that may be present as well; further research is needed to make any conclusive statements on this matter.\n**——————————**\nAcacia is a genus of shrubs or small trees in the family Fabaceae. They are native to Africa and Australia.\n \nThey have been used for centuries for their medicinal properties, as well as for building materials.\n \nAcacia plants contain strong anti-inflammatory properties, making them popular among people with allergies or asthma.\n \nIn addition, they can also help boost your immune system when taken regularly over an extended period of time (such as one month).\n \nAcacia plants are often used in religious ceremonies because of their ability to induce a deep meditative state when consumed in large quantities (i.e., more than 2 cups per day).\n———\nAcacia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It contains around 600 species of trees and shrubs, which are distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics.[1]\n \nThe first acacias were likely native to Australia,[2] but today they are found across southern Asia and Africa, as well as North and South America.\\[3]\\[4] These plants are known for their hardiness and tolerance of dry conditions, making them popular choices for landscaping projects.\\[5]\\[6]\n \nAcacia plants have been used by many different cultures throughout history for both their practical uses (such as construction materials)[7] as well as their spiritual properties.\\[8]\\[9]\\[10]\\[11] Because of this wide appeal across different demographics, these plants are often thought to be lucky,[12] or to bring good fortune upon those who come into contact with them.\\[13]\\[14]\\[15]\\[16]\n———\nAcacia is a genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the family Mimosoideae. They are found throughout tropical regions of the world, with some species extending into subtropical areas. The bark of Acacia is used for weaving cloth or making paper; it has been used for both purposes since at least 600 BCE. In addition to its use as an industrial material, Acacia also has spiritual and religious uses: it was believed by some ancient peoples to have healing properties, and many people today still consider it a source of strength during difficult times.\n \nThe name acacia comes from the Greek word ακάδιος (akádios), meaning thorny or spiny; this refers to the plant's tendency to have sharp leaves and wood with thorns embedded in them. Acacias are flowering plants that belong to the subfamily Mimosoideae within the family Leguminosae (which also includes beans and peas); they contain large amounts of phenolic compounds called flavonoids, which provide them with their yellow coloration—this trait makes them useful as a natural dye!\n", "Created"=>"2022-10-06T19:14:45.000Z", "Last Modified"=>"2022-10-25T04:43:17.000Z", "Created By"=>{"id"=>"usr9G1Rz7yXYRcW4Y", "email"=>"greg@omatum.studio", "name"=>"gmd"}, "Last Modified By"=>{"id"=>"usr9G1Rz7yXYRcW4Y", "email"=>"greg@omatum.studio", "name"=>"gmd"}, "num_magicals"=>2, "plants (from images)"=>["Acacia "], "image_cover"=>[{"id"=>"attvVfPmHA4SyW4Nq", "width"=>2771, "height"=>3565, "url"=>"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4f4e056d134784b8ea57bb063c0ee76a/81b774e7/353416.jpg", "filename"=>"353416.jpg", "size"=>597971, "type"=>"image/jpeg", "thumbnails"=>{"small"=>{"url"=>"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d0e861a1ba1dad058e69035d0394068f/bf711972", "width"=>28, "height"=>36}, "large"=>{"url"=>"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3000afa5c7425f62ec059a4359e0da41/1ab3e1e2", "width"=>512, "height"=>659}, "full"=>{"url"=>"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c49d1ae4587227ab50a3150cd2941b75/2a468096", "width"=>3000, "height"=>3000}}}], "id (from plants_magical)"=>[1, 429], "slug"=>"acacia"}
